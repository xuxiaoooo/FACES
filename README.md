## 📌 Introduction

Our **ANRFC 2023** recruited 11,427 healthy schoolchild, with their scale **DASS-21** and **Facial Video**. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest Audio-Visual dataset with a strict and standard acquisition process. Thank for the **OpenFace 2.0**, we extract comprehensive features and we calculate them to a Statistical Feature Dataset. This is the first Version of our dataset, we define it as **ANRFC 2023**.
